# Bus Reservation System

This repository hosts an interactive Bus Reservation System web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a modern, responsive design powered by Materialize CSS and provides a user-friendly interface for managing bus schedules and seat reservations.

## Features

- **Add Bus:** Create new bus entries by specifying details such as bus number, driver name, departure and arrival times, and route information.
- **Reserve Seat:** Book a seat by selecting the bus number, seat number (from 1 to 32), and entering the passenger's name.
- **Cancel Reservation:** Easily cancel a seat reservation if plans change.
- **View Buses:** Quickly view all bus details, including the number of total and available seats.
- **Delete Bus:** Remove a bus from the system with a simple form submission.
- **Available Seats:** Dynamically display a seating grid for each bus with visual cuesâ€”available seats are highlighted in green and occupied ones in red. Hover effects reveal additional passenger details for occupied seats.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Structure and semantic markup.
- **CSS3:** Custom styling with a background overlay effect and grid layout for seat arrangement.
- **JavaScript:** Application logic, event handling, and DOM manipulation to drive interactivity.
- **Materialize CSS:** A modern front-end framework for responsive design and pre-styled components.
